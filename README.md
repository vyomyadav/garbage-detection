## Overview

Urban waste monitoring is traditionally reliant on human resources. This project introduces an efficient garbage detection model using TensorFlow Lite and computer vision. The aim is to automate garbage detection through existing CCTV camera feeds, making the process not only easier to implement but economically viable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/garbage-detection.git
   cd garbage-detection
